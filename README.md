# AI Cofounder

![AI Cofounder Banner](banner.png)

**Your AI Chief of Staff for startup operations.** 48 skills that turn any AI agent into an augmented CEO: strategic reviews, hypothesis tracking, GTM playbooks, founder sales, and more.

A compilation of frameworks and insights from [Lenny Rachitsky's Podcast](https://www.lennyspodcast.com/), [Corey Haines](https://marketing-skills.com/)' marketing playbooks, and [Garry Tan](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack) (Y Combinator CEO). Get April Dunford, Elena Verna, Jen Abel, Bob Moesta, Marty Cagan, and dozens of other industry experts on your team, distilled into structured AI skills.

Built for founders who wear too many hats.

## Who is this for

**Technical founders** — honestly, this is a must-have. You're good at building product but probably underinvesting in strategy, sales, and marketing. These 48 skills fill that gap: structured frameworks for everything from weekly CEO reviews to cold email outreach, without needing to hire a Chief of Staff or a sales coach. If you catch yourself hiding in code instead of talking to customers, this system will call you out.

**CEOs and business leaders** — a structured operating system for the hard decisions. Hypothesis tracking with WIP limits. Decision playbooks for pivots and hiring. Self-deception audits that flag when you're confusing activity with progress. A constraint-first approach that keeps you focused on what actually matters. Works whether you're pre-PMF or scaling.

**Marketers** — 24 GTM skills covering positioning, content strategy, SEO, cold email, social writing, growth loops, and launch playbooks. Each skill has frameworks from practitioners like April Dunford and Jen Abel. Use them as a second brain for marketing decisions, whether you're a one-person team or running a department.

**Anyone building with AI agents** — the skills are portable. Install them into Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Cursor, Codex, OpenClaw, or any of 40+ agents that support the skills format. They work standalone or as an integrated system. Claude Cowork users get these skills automatically (same `~/.claude/skills/` directory, no extra setup).

## Install

### Any agent (Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Cursor, Codex, etc.)

Install all skills at once:

```bash
npx skills add CodeAlive-AI/ai-cofounder -g
```

Or install individual skills:

```bash
npx skills add CodeAlive-AI/ai-cofounder@hypothesis-tracker -g
npx skills add CodeAlive-AI/ai-cofounder@decision-playbook -g
npx skills add CodeAlive-AI/ai-cofounder@founder-sales -g
```

> **No terminal?** Just tell your agent: *"Install skills from https://github.com/CodeAlive-AI/ai-cofounder following the README"*

### OpenClaw (full autonomous CEO OS)

The skills work in any agent, but [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) is where the full system comes alive. The agent lives in your Telegram, WhatsApp, or Discord. It sends you insights on its own, runs daily recaps, tracks hypotheses across sessions, and nudges you when you're drifting from the constraint. You don't open it. It just works in the background.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeAlive-AI/ai-cofounder.git
cd ai-cofounder/openclaw
./install.sh
```

Then customize for your company — see [openclaw/CUSTOMIZATION.md](openclaw/CUSTOMIZATION.md). Full setup guide: [openclaw/README.md](openclaw/README.md).

## What is this?

48 skills organized into a CEO operating system. Each skill is a structured workflow with frameworks from 100+ product leaders. They work standalone, but together they form a system:

- **Weekly CEO reviews** with self-deception checks
- **Hypothesis tracking** with WIP limits and evidence tiers
- **Decision playbooks** for pivots, hiring, pricing, and more
- **Discovery debriefs** that extract structured learnings from customer conversations
- **GTM skills** covering positioning, sales, content, SEO, email, and launch
- **Proactive nudges** via heartbeat — insights, coaching, and daily recaps (OpenClaw only)

The system is opinionated. It follows a constraint-first approach (Theory of Constraints), uses evidence tiers to separate signal from noise, and checks for self-deception patterns that founders usually don't notice on their own.

```bash
# One-time setup
npm install -g mcporter
# Then configure your API keys — see docs/adding-tools.md
```

The other 40 skills work out of the box with no external dependencies.

## Key concepts

### Evidence tiers

Not all signals are equal. The system uses 5 tiers to assess evidence quality:

1. **Tier 1**: Costly-to-fake behavioral (paid pilots, expansion, renewals)
2. **Tier 2**: Product evidence (session replays, drop-offs, support tickets)
3. **Tier 3**: Commercial evidence (win/loss, objections, stalled deals)
4. **Tier 4**: Market narrative (competitor moves, content performance)
5. **Tier 5**: Low-power (praise, vanity traffic, investor excitement)

### Hypothesis management

Hypotheses follow the format: *"For [ICP] who [trigger], if we [change], then [metric] will move from X to Y by [date], because [evidence]."*

WIP limits: max 3 active hypotheses, max 2 concurrent experiments. Relay race rule: if evidence is sufficient before the deadline — decide now.

### Self-deception checks

25 anti-patterns organized in 5 blocks: general founder mistakes, ex-engineer mistakes, metric interpretation, pre-PMF growth, and AI-era pitfalls. The agent flags these during weekly reviews and monthly audits.

## OpenClaw integration

The `openclaw/` directory has the full workspace setup:

- **SOUL.md** — AI Chief of Staff persona with constraint-first thinking
- **MEMORY.md** — Structured company context (wedge, ICP, stage, constraint)
- **HEARTBEAT.md** — Proactive nudge cadence (insights, coaching, daily recaps)
- **AGENTS.md** — Skill routing and disambiguation rules
- **Memory system** — Daily logs, weekly reviews, hypothesis tracker

See [openclaw/README.md](openclaw/README.md) for setup instructions.

## Works great with CodeAlive

[CodeAlive](https://codealive.ai) is an AI context platform for codebases. It lets agents instantly get answers about how anything works in a repository (architecture, dependencies, cross-service patterns) without reading thousands of files. If your startup builds software, the [codealive-context-engine](https://github.com/CodeAlive-AI/codealive-skills) skill gives the CEO OS direct access to your codebase for deeper technical context during strategic reviews and investigations.

2. **[Corey Haines' Marketing Skills](https://marketing-skills.com/)** — 8 skills for copywriting, cold email, SEO, content strategy, email sequences, and programmatic SEO. Practical frameworks from a SaaS marketer. Source: [coreyhaines31/marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills) (MIT).

3. **[Garry Tan's gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack)** — Inspired the strategic review modes (EXPAND / SELECTIVE / HOLD / REDUCE) and structured decision-making patterns.

4. **[First Principles Framework (FPF)](https://github.com/ailev/FPF/blob/main/FPF-Spec.md)** by Anatoly Levenchuk — Transdisciplinary reasoning architecture for rigorous decomposition of complex problems. Used in `fpf-problem-solving` skill.

5. **CEO Bible** — A research document on the role of CEO in an early-stage startup, synthesized by GPT-5.4 Pro from 50+ sources (Goldratt's Theory of Constraints, Horowitz's Wartime CEO, Bezos's two-way doors, Jobs's subtraction, and others). Powers the CEO OS skills: weekly reviews, hypothesis tracking, anti-pattern audits, decision playbooks, and constraint-first thinking.
